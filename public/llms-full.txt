# Gitto - Complete Product & Company Documentation

## Executive Summary

Gitto is a Deterministic Treasury Intelligence platform that transforms how enterprise finance teams manage cash forecasting. Unlike traditional treasury software that operates on "Theoretical Cash" - numbers that exist in a model but don't exist in the bank - Gitto anchors liquidity predictions in actual bank receipts, intercompany washes, and deterministic behavioral bias analysis.

**Tagline**: "Cash Truth is the Only Reality"

## The Problem We Solve

### The Trust Deficit

Finance teams operate on "Theoretical Cash" - numbers that exist in a model but don't exist in the bank. We close the gap.

### Core Problems Addressed

1. **Behavioral Bias**
   - Real life averages 14+ days of unmodeled delay
   - Enterprise customers pay based on their own payment runs, internal bottlenecks, and liquidity constraints—not your invoice terms
   - Gitto maps these unique behavioral patterns to find the hidden delays before they hit your runway

2. **Explainability Crisis**
   - Black-box forecasts are useless to CFOs
   - When a forecast drops by €2M, "the model said so" is unacceptable
   - Gitto provides provenance for every variance, linked to actual MT940 wires and invoice line items

3. **Fragmented Liquidity**
   - Managing group cash shouldn't require 14 different portal logins
   - Gitto normalizes global bank data (MT940/BAI2) into a single truth layer

4. **Static Variance Analysis**
   - Weekly meetings waste 45 minutes debating "which data is right"
   - Gitto's automated variance tracking eliminates the debate

## Product Architecture: The Deterministic Stack

### Module 01: Ingest Layer - MT940 Bank-Truth Reconciliation

**Purpose**: Automatically match MT940 and BAI2 statements against open ledger items

**Capabilities**:
- Parse and ingest MT940/BAI2 bank statements in real-time
- Identify wires, net out fees
- Identify intercompany washes with 99.8% precision
- Real-time ledger synchronization
- Slack notifications for unmatched wires

**Technical Specifications**:
- Live latency: ~14.2ms
- Bank ingest: Real-time
- Supported formats: MT940, BAI2, API weblinks

### Module 02: Bias AI - Behavioral Variance Detection

**Purpose**: Learn customer payment habit shifts to predict actual cash timing

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes historical payment patterns per customer
- Detects "Regime Shifts" - when a customer's payment behavior changes
- Predicts actual cash timing vs. theoretical due dates
- Typical detection: +14 day delay insight

**Key Insight**: We learn customer payment habit shifts (Regime Shifts) to predict actual cash timing, not just due dates.

### Module 03: Sim Engine - Scenario Levers

**Purpose**: Model "What-If" liquidity scenarios

**Capabilities**:
- Vendor delay modeling
- SaaS acceleration scenarios
- Real-time ROI projection
- 13-week forecast manipulation
- Week-by-week scenario comparison

### Module 04: Insight RAG - Analyst with Citations

**Purpose**: Provide explainable AI insights grounded in verifiable data

**How It Works**:
- Every insight is retrieved from specific bank truth and invoice reality
- Citations link to actual bank receipts (e.g., #BAI2-992, #INV-441)
- No black-box AI answers

**Example Output**:
"W3 forecast dropped €2.1M due to a regime shift in Enterprise-SaaS payment habits. Found citations in 42 bank receipts."

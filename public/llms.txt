# Gitto - Deterministic Treasury Intelligence

> Gitto is an enterprise treasury management platform that provides deterministic cash forecasting by anchoring liquidity predictions in actual bank receipts (MT940/BAI2), intercompany netting, and behavioral payment bias analysis.

## Product Overview

Gitto eliminates the "Bank-Truth Gap" - the dangerous disconnect between theoretical cash forecasts and actual bank reality. Most treasury software displays assumptions in graphs, but assumptions don't pay bills—cash does.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. MT940/BAI2 Bank-Truth Reconciliation
Automatically match MT940 and BAI2 statements against open ledger items. The engine identifies wires, nets out fees, and identifies intercompany washes with 99.8% precision.

### 2. Behavioral Bias AI
Learns customer payment habit shifts (Regime Shifts) to predict actual cash timing, not just due dates. Detects the hidden 14-day delay before it hits your runway.

### 3. Scenario Simulation Engine  
Model "What-If" liquidity levers like vendor delays or SaaS acceleration with real-time ROI projection across 13-week forecasts.

### 4. Analyst RAG with Citations
Every insight is retrieved from specific bank truth and invoice reality, grounded in verifiable citations. No black-box AI answers.
